        		<h4>Risks of funding projects on CrowdCredit</h4>
        		<p></p>
        		<p>CrowdCredit is a crowdfunding platform, you are completely free to invest in any project you choose. You are giving people and start-ups a change to grow their business and dreams on their own, but sadly enough this does not always work out for various reasons. In that case, your investment will not be returned.</p>
        		<p>On the other hand, when a project is succesful and evolving on its own, chances are high that your fund will return. At this stage it's still not sure wether that includes an interest or not. Depending on which sector and area the project is situated in, money might still be tight.</p>
        		<p>And in the case a project you funded gains a lot of success, there's again a higher chance to receive the full amount back with or without interest. You do not own part of the startup and are only eligible to the amount you funded, including the mentioned interest rate.</p>
